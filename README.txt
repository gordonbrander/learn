== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will you ad "X" to the theme? =

Have a great idea? I would love to hear about it! Send it my way. If I think it fits within the theme's goal of being as conceptually simple and helpful as possible, I'll add it.

If I don't add it, you can always add it yourself and release your work. That's the beauty of open source!

= What are those &lt;?php ?&gt; things? =

WordPress is software written in a language called PHP. Basically, wherever you see those tags, WordPress is doing some kind of magic. An intro to PHP is outside the scope of this document, but the good news is, you don't have to know much to modify WordPress! Try tinkering and see how far that gets you. If you want to learn more, try getting an *intro to programming* book, or dig around here <http://www.php.net/tut.php>.

= What's up with the doctype? =

It's HTML5 <http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/>.

= Why isn't this theme internationalized? =

The goal of this theme is to be a starting point that is as conceptually simple as possible. I figure when you're starting out internationalization is too much to wrap your head around on top of everything else.

Internationalization, or I18n is when you use a programming language to replace strings of text in the theme with a translation from your own language. WordPress supports language packs you can install so people of all languages can easily use it. Learn more about I18n here <http://codex.wordpress.org/I18n_for_WordPress_Developers>

As with anything in this theme, you can add internationalization to it yourself (it's not too difficult) and release the results.

= I found a bug. Where can I submit it? =

If you've run into unexpected behavior while using the theme, do please file a bug report at <http://github.com/gordonbrander/learn/issues>
