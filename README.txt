== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What's up with the doctype? =

It's [HTML5] (http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/).

= Why isn't this theme internationalized? =

The goal of this theme is to be a starting point that is as conceptually simple as possible. I figured when you're just starting out, internationalization is too complex to wrap your head around on top of everything else.

You can add internationalization to it yourself (it's not too difficult). Internationalization, or I18n is when you use a programming language to replace sentences and strings of text in the theme with a translation from your own language. WordPress supports language packs you can install, making this super easy. Learn more about it here <http://codex.wordpress.org/I18n_for_WordPress_Developers>
